# Machine-Learning

This repository contains my learning journey in Machine Learning, from basics to advanced projects.  
Each folder covers a different aspect of ML with clean Jupyter notebooks.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- **basics/** â†’ Fundamental math & loss functions (MSE, MAE, Gradient Descent, etc.)
- **supervised_learning/** â†’ Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
- **unsupervised_learning/** â†’ K-Means, PCA, Clustering
- **reinforcement_learning/** â†’ Q-learning, CartPole, Bandit problems
- **projects/** â†’ End-to-end ML projects (house price prediction, customer segmentation, etc.)

## ðŸ”— Open in Google Colab
Each notebook has a Colab link for easy execution.
